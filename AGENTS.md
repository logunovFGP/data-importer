# AGENTS.md

This directory is a workspace boundary for AI assistants.

## Mandatory local instructions
- Read the repository root `AGENTS.md` first.
- This directory is currently a minimal workspace shell; verify contents before making edits.
- Do not assume a checked-out code tree exists under this folder without verifying.
- Avoid speculative edits until the intended working files are present.
- Keep any changes scoped and documented in an applicable plan file before code updates.

## Read order in this directory
1. `../AGENTS.md`
2. `AGENTS.md` (this file)
3. Any visible source files once they are available
