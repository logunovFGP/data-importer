# firefly-iii-importer

## Module context
- Name: firefly-iii-importer
- Role: Workspace placeholder for local importer plugin/runtime integration.
- Current status: module currently contains minimal content (boundary marker only).

## Operational guidance for assistants
- Treat as a workspace boundary; avoid speculative edits until target runtime files appear.
- Prefer creating context files and guardrails before making code changes when active assets are added.
- Respect root and sibling-module instructions when integrating future code.

## Planned setup notes
- Add module-specific code and context files only when concrete source assets are introduced.
- Continue using root-level AGENTS constraints for behavior and verification policy.
